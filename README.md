# We created a digital stopwatch that allows users to start the clock, stop, reset, pause and play it.
We added a bonus feature of an alarm clock that is not fully functional.
The program runs via terminal and is written in C.
We used an external library called 'kbhit' to detect when a user hits a keyboard key.
We used signals to stop the program and a subprocess to run the clock. 
We also used threads to detect the keyboard hit and check which key was hit.
